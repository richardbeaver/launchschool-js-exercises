// Using the following code, create a towMixin mixin that contains a method
// named tow that returns I can tow a trailer! when invoked. Include the
// mixin in the Truck class.

const towMixin = {
  tow() {
    return 'I can tow a trailer!';
  }
};

class Truck {}

Object.assign(Truck.prototype, towMixin);

class Car {}

//

let truck = new Truck();
console.log(truck.tow());
